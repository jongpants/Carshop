<h2>About</h2>
This web application is made by Jong Lau for Haaga-Helias frontend programming course as a small assignment which I later used as a base design for the course project.
Since it is just a small assignment that was meant to be submitted, its features are not necessary to explain here. You can move to see my other project Personaltrainer which is based off of this one for more information.
